In this project, we presented a system for classifying images of flowers using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The system is trained and tested on a dataset of images of flowers, where each image is labeled with the species of flower it depicts. We evaluate the performance of the system using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Our system achieves high accuracy in classifying images of flowers, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs in this task. Overall, the proposed system is a valuable tool for automating the identification of flower species, which can have applications in fields such as conservation, agriculture, and research. Additionally, the findings in this project could be extend to other image classification tasks such as plant recognition in general.
